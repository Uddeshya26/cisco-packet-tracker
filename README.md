Cisco Packet Tracer files demonstrating basic network topologies for hands-on learning and practice.

## Topologies Included

- **Star Topology** – Centralized network with one main switch or hub.
- **Mesh Topology** – Fully connected network for high redundancy.

---

## 🌐 How They Work

### ⭐ Star Topology
- All devices (PCs, printers, etc.) connect to a **central device** (usually a switch or hub).
- The central device manages data transmission between nodes.

### 🔗 Mesh Topology
- Every device is connected to **every other device**.
- Data can take multiple paths to reach its destination, ensuring high availability.

---

## ✅ Advantages & ❌ Disadvantages

### ⭐ Star Topology

**Advantages:**
- Easy to set up and manage
- Simple to add or remove devices
- One cable failure doesn't affect the whole network

**Disadvantages:**
- If the central device fails, the whole network goes down
- More cabling than bus topology
- Performance depends on the central device

---

### 🔗 Mesh Topology

**Advantages:**
- High redundancy and reliability
- Failure of one link doesn't affect the network
- Supports high data traffic

**Disadvantages:**
- Expensive and complex to install
- Requires more cabling and configuration
- Difficult to scale in large networks
